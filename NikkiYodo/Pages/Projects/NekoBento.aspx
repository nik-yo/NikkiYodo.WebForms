        My girlfriend's birthday was approaching and I was thinking of a special present.
        Since she likes bear, I was thinking of making something with bear theme, 
        but ended up making a simple Neko Bento.

        It has lots of rice, vegetables, and of course, tako (octopus) sausages and tamagoyaki (fried egg).
        The cat's ears are made of nori (seaweed). The eyes and mouth are made of tamagoyaki layered with nori.
        Nose from sausage. And whiskers from cut longbeans. It was lots of fun.
