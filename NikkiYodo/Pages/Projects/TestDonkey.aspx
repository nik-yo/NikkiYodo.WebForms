        When I was in Indonesia in 2020, I found AWS Indonesian group from Meetup.
        After decently active in the group, I was asked to give an online talk.
        For somewhat reason, the word TestDonkey appeared to me as a good name for my test environment.

        After setting up the test environment, I am curious if I can somehow create a mascot or logo for TestDonkey.
        Below is my initial sketch on used notebook.

        I showed it to my girlfriend and she said the right one is cuter.
        Alright! I will try to convert the right one to a graphic.
        Then I found Krita software. However, I don't have a tablet.
        That's fine, I thought, I will just import it to Krita and trace it.

        I rely heavily on the Bezier tool and Colorize Mask which are super convenient.
        After few hours trying to figure out how everything works, TestDonkey is done!
        It was a very fun experience since I'm not a graphic designer.
