            Baking and I do not go together, but I wanted to have a 3-milk cake after a long time. 
            Actually, I can get one from a store. Sadly, the store nearby can't have it readily available.
            So I decided to check what it needs to bake one.
        </p>
        <p>
            After finding the recipe online, I think I can bake one since it's not terribly hard.
            Besides my sister has all the tools necessary, so all I need are ingredients.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with the recipe, I also looked into brief history of tres leches and how to pronounce it.
            The easiest way for me is to pronounce it as "trace lay-chays". It is apparently very popular in South America.
            With that, I have enough to get started.

            The main thing on tres leches is, of course, the different types of milk. They are condensed milk, evaporated milk and coconut milk.
            The milk are mixed and let simmered on low heat while the actual cake is baked in the oven.

            Once the cake is ready, the milk can be poured on it so it will be absorbed.
            It is important for the milk to be not too hot since it might ruin the cake.

            After that, the cake has to be cooled down by putting it on the fridge for couple of hours.
            Then the yummy cake is ready to be served.
