    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        It was still on my first semester as computer science student. 
        I was being bombarded by C at that time and I had to take OOP class at the same time.
        Guess what? Like many others, I approached Java like how I approached C.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I managed to pass the class, it was not until much later 
        when I encountered C#.Net and VB.Net before I realized OOP required a different way of thinking.
        It was when I first played with Android (version 2.1 at that time), I had another opportunity to use Java correctly.

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        Other than class, I used Java when I first explored development for Android.
        I also used Java for my current company's Android app which will be released shortly.
