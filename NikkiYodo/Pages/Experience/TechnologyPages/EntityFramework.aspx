    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        I was working on my personal website and was managing the database directly.
        When I was reading some articles, I happened to read on Entity Framework.
        EF was at early years of development, so it had limited functionality.
        But it was so easy to use and I hardly need to touch the database directly,
        which is very nice since I do most development by myself.
    </p>

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        I applied Entity Framework to most of my personal projects.
        That way, it took the burden of managing the database away from me so 
        I can focus on the application itself.
