    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        Most RESTful web service will use JSON as its primary structure for data transfer.
        When I learned about REST is also when I learned more about JSON and 
        have been using it ever since for various purposes.

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        I used it mainly for AJAX or RESTful web service call on various projects both personal and work.
        Other than that, I introduce JSON to a friend who wants to easily persist and read structured data in text file.
