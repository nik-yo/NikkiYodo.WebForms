    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        The only time I work very closely with SSL is when we need to update SSL certificate at my current workplace.
        Our IT guy was busy so it wasn't done for a while.
        I decided to learn on how to get it done since I had a bit of experience requesting certificate and
        having it installed in my personal hosting environment.
        Eventually, we got it updated before our IT guy has the opportunity to do so.

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        Not much, I updated SSL certificates on some web application.
