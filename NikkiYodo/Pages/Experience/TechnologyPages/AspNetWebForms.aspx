    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        It was in Envision when my supervisor wanted me to create some sort of application to 
        give him a better visibility on the manufacturing progress. 
        The application that we had in place at that time was only a windows form and 
        it required installation for any updates, so I decided to learn web technology and picked up on ASP.NET Web Forms.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started by making my personal website. It was the predecessor of this website.
        x10 hosting was the first hosting company I was with.
    </p>
    <p>
        With some basic experience, I managed to get an interview with Data Center Inc. (DCI).
        At that time, during my interview, Daren, one of the interviewers, actually viewed my website!
    </p>
    <p>
        After gaining some experience in DCI, I managed to pass my ASP.NET Web Application Development in .NET 4.0 certification.
    </p>

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        My personal website was made from scratch using ASP.NET Web Forms.
        Professionally, I have helped maintained ASP.NET Web Forms applications since my position in DCI until present day.
