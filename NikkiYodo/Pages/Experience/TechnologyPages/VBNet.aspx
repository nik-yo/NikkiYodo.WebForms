    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        I had a bit of experience with Visual Basic before I learned VB.NET.
        The first time I learned VB.NET was in DCI.
        After I joined WorkView, VB.NET was also the preferred language.
    </p>

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        I used VB.NET started with DCI until now. However, I don't use VB.NET for my personal projects.
        The other time I used VB.NET was when I was helping my girlfriend with her class project.
