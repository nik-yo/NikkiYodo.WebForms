    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        My first task when I started working as Graduate Assistant was to read the book on Stata.
        We used it extensively at work and my professor was an expert in it.
        It is very easy to use and I learned a lot of essential programming logic just by using it.

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        The only time I used Stata is during my job as Graduate Assistant (3 years).
        I started with version 9 and version 10 was the last version that I used.
        We used Stata to connect remotely to many real estate databases, downloading the data, 
        ran analysis on the data, and export the result to Excel.
        I created two custom commands for the whole process.
        One to download and one to analyze and export.
        And we ran them monthly and we send the reports to real estate boards all over Kansas.
