    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        Telerik UI was the latest controls library I used in DCI.
        It is highly customizable and complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        One pleasant memory I had was when I was assigned to replace our Silverlight plugin with 
        Telerik's Rad Image Editor. At that time, I found a bug and reported it. As the result,
        we were given $5 discount for Telerik product. Well, better than nothing.
    </p>

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        We used it in DCI and I customized their Rad Image Editor control to suit our needs in replacing
        our Silverlight image viewer.
