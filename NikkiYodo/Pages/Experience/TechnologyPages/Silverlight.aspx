    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        In DCI, we had this third-party-built Silverlight plugin to view images.
        However, it lacked one intuitive functionality, which is to enable image scrolling using mouse scroll wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, I decided to poke around to see if I can add that functionality.
        That is when I learned a lot about Silverlight.
        After few weeks, I managed to get it to work.
        Little did I know that the request to add that functionality has been opened for 2 years.
        Chandler, one of the implementation department staff, was so happy that we managed to add that for our customers.

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        I only modified and maintaining existing Silverlight plugin and never created one from scratch.
