    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        A visual programming language with drag and drop capability.
        I first learned about it in HKN Conference in Oklahoma in 2010.
        We had a Lego Mindstorm Sumo Bot competition and programming has to be done in LabVIEW.
        So, I decided to learn it in a night. Competition in 3rd day, what choice do I have?
        My team eventually managed to snag runner up.

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        Other than that Lego Mindstorm Sumo Bot competition, I never had the opportunity to use LabVIEW again.
