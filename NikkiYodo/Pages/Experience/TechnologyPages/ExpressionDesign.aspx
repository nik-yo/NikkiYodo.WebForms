    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        I was looking for a software to create icon and I happened to bump into Microsoft Expression Design.
        It was very easy to use and immediately becomes my preferred software for graphics related tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was not free at first but not too long after I used it the first time,
        Microsoft decided not to continue its development and make it free of charge.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        I used it extensively both at work and personal to create or modify graphics,
        such as making icons, shapes, etc.
