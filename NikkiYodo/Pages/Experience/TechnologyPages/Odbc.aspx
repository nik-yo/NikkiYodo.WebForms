    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        The first time I used ODBC was when we were trying to connect to real estate databases.
        I was working as a Graduate Assistant at that time.
        Our main software, Stata, was not able to connect directly, thus, we used ezRETS ODBC driver.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from that, I used ODBC when I first learned about ASP.NET Web Forms to connect to MySQL database.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        Apart from connecting Stata with real estate databases and my first iteration of my personal website to MySQL database,
        I have not used ODBC ever since.
