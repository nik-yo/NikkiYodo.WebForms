    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        It was an interesting team we had in my Software Engineering class. 
        My team leader was from UK, the other two were from US and India.
        Our professor had a software development project for us in which there will be 4 iterations and
        each iteration, the requirement will change.
    </p>
    <p>
        My team leader suggested to use Python and to my surprise, it was not hard to learn.
        I was in charge of making charts using Python and we managed to meet our deadlines every time.

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        So far, I used Python only in my software engineering class.
        Apart from it, I helped a friend learning Python.
