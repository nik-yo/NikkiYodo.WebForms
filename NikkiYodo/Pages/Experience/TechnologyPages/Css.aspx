    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        Same as HTML, I first learned about CSS in Web Design workshop during my undergraduate year.
        I learned a lot about styling when I explored CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
        As one of the main technology for web development, 
        I have been using CSS since my work for DCI until now.
        I also use the latest version of CSS, i.e. CSS 3, extensively.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the certification for CSS 3 is bundled together with HTML 5, 
        that means I'm also certified for CSS 3.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        The same as HTML, I used CSS for this website,
        my church web application, and also many other personal projects.
        Along with that, the Google App Script spreadsheet that I created for my church's worship team also required a bit of CSS.
