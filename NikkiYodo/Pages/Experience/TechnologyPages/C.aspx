    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        C is the first programming language I encountered when pursuing my degree in Computer Science.
        It is part of the core classes that I had to take because I changed major during my graduate studies from Aerospace Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        On my first semester, I found myself having to take Data Structure class which has C programming class as the pre-requisite.
        At that time, I was not sure if I can pass by taking two classes at the same time, so I decided to ask my Data Structure professor what she thinks about it.
        She had no problem with that and asked me to give it a try.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first challenge is the 5-question background knowledge homework in Data Structure class which has to be solved using C and there I was with zero knowledge of it.
        In order to at least be able to understand the homework, I spent a lot of time consulting the book that I borrowed from my friend and the class textbook.
        By God's grace, I managed to score full mark on the homework and my computer science journey off to a good start.
    </p>

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        Outside of class, I never used C professionally.
        But I did tutor and help some juniors with their programming homework.
