    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        It was first introduced by my Structure teacher when I was pursuing Aerospace Engineering in WSU.
        Maple is very pleasant to use to solve mathematics formula as you can type in the formula
        in a visually very close to handwritten look.

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        I only used Maple in probably 3 Structure classes during my undergraduate years in WSU.
