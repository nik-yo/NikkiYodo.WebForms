    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        The html was introduced to me when I was taking Web Design workshop in WSU.
        I didn't understand much of it even until I learned ASP.NET Web Forms since
        I used a lot of server controls.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, at my current job, we used it extensively. 
        I also used it a lot in any web related personal projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        I started by learning HTML 4, XHTML and now HTML 5.
        I also managed to get certified in HTML 5.
    </p>

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        I definitely used it in any web related applications.
        Apart from this website, I used it a lot at work and in making our church web applications, web applications at work since DCI,
        helped my girlfriend with her MIS class and other personal projects.
        I also created a Google Apps Script spreadsheet for my church's worship team to manage schedule which required html for the forms.
