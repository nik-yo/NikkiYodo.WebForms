    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        In Envision, I was first hired to manage Microsoft Excel.
        Soon, I found out that my supervisor wanted something else and Microsoft Excel was not suitable for it.
        So, I decided to make a simple custom MRP application in Windows Forms using C#.
        The application was being used for some time until the requirements grow and I learned web development.

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        Professionally, I created Windows Forms application for Envision.
        Outside of professional world, I helped a friend with his project in Windows Forms for his company.
