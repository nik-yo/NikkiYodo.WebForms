    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        My first encounter with C++ was actually in Introduction to Networking class.
        During that time, my team was tasked to implement Hungarian algorithm and 
        our team leader chose to use C++.
    </p>
    <p>
        Apart from that, I explored C++ more after I graduated by trying to implement
        some search and sorting algorithms that I learned from my Data Structure class.
        I also helped some friends with their C++ homework.
    </p>

    <h3>Utilization</h3>
    <p>
        Only some search and sorting algorithm as personal exploration into the language.
