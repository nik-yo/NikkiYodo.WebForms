    <p>
        I was born in Indonesia, so I have learned Indonesian since young.
        However, I can't say I speak it very well as I am away from the country for many years.

        Being rooted in Sanskrit, Indonesian shares some words with Indian.

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>We love to shorten words in Indonesian.</li>
        <li>According to outsiders, Indonesian is spoken very fast.</li>
        <li>Acronyms are everywhere.</li>
        <li>No tenses and easy plurals are a plus.</li>
        <li>Indonesian is loaded with slangs.</li>
    </ul>
