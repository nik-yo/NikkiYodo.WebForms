        Hokkien is my mother tongue. It is a dialect of Chinese languages.
        I was told that it originated from Fujian area in China, 
        although there is a difference between theirs and ours.
    </p>
    <p>
        Being a dialect of Chinese languages, it bore some similarities such as different intonation for different meaning of the same word.
        However, I don't think we have our own writings. To write, we have to borrow from Mandarin.

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>There are many famous Hokkien songs to my surprise.</li>
        <li>Some complex, rarely used terms are rarely passed on to the next generation.</li>
    </ul>
