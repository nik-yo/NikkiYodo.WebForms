    <p>
        I have been fascinated with Japanese language and culture for a long time.
        On 2019, I decided to pick up the language and found a very interesting world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Until now, I learn Japanese through JapanesePod101 and Duolingo. 
        I also read some Kanji books.

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 sets of characters: Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji.</li>
        <li>Kanji is actually traditional Chinese character.</li>
        <li>There are a lot of onomatopoeia in Japanese.</li>
        <li>4 levels of politeness.</li>
        <li>There words reserved for either male or female.</li>
        <li>2 tenses: present and past.</li>
        <li>Japanese loves to shorten words and sometimes, it is significantly shorter.</li>
        <li>Context is heavily depended upon. A single word can mean a lot.</li>
        <li>Particles are very important.</li>
        <li>I think Japanese doesn't have as wide range of vocabulary as other languages but it is very interesting how they used words.</li>
        <li>Correct pronunciation is actually pretty hard, but native speakers can understand you just fine if you miss it.</li>
        <li>Elongated words have different meaning.</li>
    </ul>
