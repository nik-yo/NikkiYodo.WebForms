        As far as I remember, I started learning English back in the first year of Elementary school.
        During that time, I also started attending a private course center named Meili. They are no longer in business.
        From there I went through a handful other private course centers listed below.

    <ul>
        <li>Meili</li>
        <li>Best</li>
        <li>EF (English First)</li>
        <li>IEC</li>
    </ul>

        After I graduated from high school, I attended ADP program in Taylor's College in Malaysia.
        And of course, English 101 and English 102 are part of the curriculum.

        Eventually I transferred to the US. Being in the midwest part of US for couple of years really boost my English.
        I found out that it is better than some friends that study in big cities.

    <h4>Notes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Syllable emphasis is very important in English. Native speaker often gets confused when I stress the wrong syllable.</li>
        <li>Pronunciation are very important too. Wrong pronunciation throws native speakers off.</li>
        <li>Context in English often doesn't get carried to the next sentence unlike many Asian languages.</li>
        <li>Tenses and gender pronouns (he, she, it) often cause me to trip.</li>
        <li>The v and th in English is hard for me for many years.</li>
        <li>Phrases and slangs are very common.</li>
    </ul>
