    <p>
        Such refined skill in the fine art of emotional influence is
        perhaps best exemplified by a story told by an old friend, the
        late Terry Dobson, who in the 1950s was one of the first Americans
        ever to study the martial art aikido in Japan. One afternoon
        he was riding home on a suburban Tokyo train when a huge,
        bellicose, and very drunk and begrimed laborer got on. The
        man, staggering, began terrorizing the passengers: screaming
        curses, he took a swing at a woman holding a baby, sending
        her sprawling in the laps of an elderly couple, who then 
        jumped up and joined a stampede to the other end of the car.
        The drunk, taking a few other swings (and, in his rage, missing),
        grabbed the metal pole in the middle of the car with a
        roar and tried to tear it out of its socket.
    </p>
    <p>
        At that point Terry, who was in the peak physical condition from
        daily eight-hour aikido workouts, fell called upon to intervene,
        lest someone get seriously hurt. But he recalled the words of
        his teacher: "Aikido is the art of reconciliation. Whoever has
        the mind to fight has broken his connection with the universe.
        If you try to dominate people you are already defeated. We
        study how to resolve conflict, not how to start it."
    </p>
    <p>
        Indeed, Terry had agreed upon beginning lessons with his
        teacher never to pick a fight, and to use his martial-arts skills
        only in defense. Now, at least, he saw his chance to test his
        opportunity. So, as all the other passengers sat frozen in their
        seats, Terry stood up, slowly and with deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Seeing him, the drunk roared, "Aha! A foreigner! You need
        a lesson in Japanese manners!" And began gathering himself to
        take on Terry.
    </p>
    <p>
        But just as the drunk was on the verge of making his move,
        someone gave an earplitting, oddly joyous shout: "Hey!"
    </p>
    <p>
        The shout had the cheery tone of someone who has suddenly
        come upon a fond friend. The drunk, surprised, spun
        around to see a tiny Japanese man, probably in his seventies,
        sitting there in a kimono. The old man beamed with delight
        at the drunk, and beckoned him over with a light wave of his
        hand and a lilting "C'mere."
    </p>
    <p>
        The drunk strode over with a belligerent, "Why the hell
        should I talk to you?" Meanwhile, Terry was ready to fell the
        drunk in a moment if he made the least violent move.
    </p>
    <p>
        "What'cha been drinking?" the old man asked, his eyes
        beaming at the drunken laborer.
    </p>
    <p>
        "I been drinking sake, and it's none of your business," the
        drunk bellowed.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Oh, that's wonderful, absolutely wonderful," the old man
        replied in a warm tone. "You see, I love sake, too. Every night,
        me and my wife (she's seventy-six, you know), we warm up
        a little bottle of sake and take it out into the garden, and we
        sit on an old wooden bench..." He continued on about the
        persimmon tree in his backyard, the fortunes of his garden,
        enjoying sake in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
        The drunk's face began to soften as he listened to the
        old man; his fists unclenched. "Yeah...I love persimmons,
        too...," he said, his voice trailing off.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Yes," the old man replied in a sprightly voice, "and I'm sure
        you have a wonderful wife."
    </p>
    <p>
        "No," said the laborer. "My wife died...." Sobbing, he 
        launched into a sad tale of losing his wife, his home, his job,
        of being ashamed of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just then the train came to Terry's stop, and as he was getting
        off he turned to hear the old man invite the drunk to join
        him and tell him all about it, and to see the drunk sprawl along
        the seat, his head in the old man's lap.
    </p>
    <p>That is emotional brilliance.</p>
